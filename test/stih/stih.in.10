sad eyed lady of the lowlands
where the sad eyed prophet says that no man comes
my warehouse eyes my arabian drums
should i leave them by your gate
or sad eyed lady should i wait
with your silhouette when the sunlight dims
into your eyes where the moonlight swims
and your match book songs and your gypsy hymns
who among them would try to impress you
